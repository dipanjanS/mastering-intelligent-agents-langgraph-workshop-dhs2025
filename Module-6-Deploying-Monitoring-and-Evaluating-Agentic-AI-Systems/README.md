## Module 6 - Deploying, Monitoring, and Evaluating Agentic AI Systems

Turn a working agent into a reliable web service API. Package a LangGraph agent behind a FastAPI endpoint, run it on the cloud, and support for API calling and async live streaming. Instrument the system with tracing, monitoring and observability metrics, and evaluation runs. Use LangSmith to monitor latency, cost, tool calls, errors, and agent goal, reasoning and trajectory quality.
